    <p>My friend's birthday is in July so we partied and had a lot of fun.we were literally <em>WASTED</em>. 
        Oh and my ex was there so we talked after four months and sort of got <strong>back together</strong> 
        that night. LOL (sorry i didn't really have any important words so I just chose the words 
        "back together" for strong and "wasted" to emphasize)</p>

        <p>I like watching movies and listening to music in my free time. I also love 
            socializing with people and making new friends.</p>
