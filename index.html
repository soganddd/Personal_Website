    <p>My friend's birthday is in July so we partied and had a lot of fun.we were literally WASTED. Oh and my 
        ex was there so we talked after four months and sort of got back together 
        that night. LOL (sorry i didn't really have any important words so I just chose the words 
        "back together" and "wasted" to emphasize)</p>

        <p>I like watching movies and listening to music in my free time. I also love 
            socializing with people and making new friends.</p>

 Some of the courses that I'm taking are:

 <ul>
    <li>Intro to System Admin 1420</li> 
    <li><a href= "https://www.bcit.ca/outlines/20213048468/"> Database Systems 1630</a></li>
